# FindPath
## Software Development
* Python was used for all the creation and Object Oriented structuring of the program.
* The TKinter and PyGame libraries were used for the graphical interface.
* The math library was also used for the calculations used.
## Functionalities
* The program starts by asking for the coordinates of the start and end of the points.
* After that, the user must create the obstacles in the grid field.
* Then the program starts testing all the possibilities, which, if the user checks the "show steps" field, will be shown in the program.
* This table shows the shortest path from two predefined points, avoiding the obstacle created by the user.
